    console.log(players, copy_players0);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    copy_players0.push('NewZero');

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(`players: ${players}`);
    console.log(`copy_players0: ${copy_players0}`);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const copy_players1 = players.slice(0);
    //const copy_players1 = players.slice();  //the same

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy_players2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy_players3 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    copy_players1.push('NewOne');
    copy_players2.push('NewTwo');

    console.log(`copy_players4: ${copy_players4}`);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const new_person0 = person;
    new_person0.number = 99;

    console.log('person: ', person);
    console.log('new_person0: ', new_person0);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const new_person1 = Object.assign({}, person, {id_number: 99});
    console.log('new_person1: ', new_person1);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const new_person2 = {...person};
    // console.log('new_person2: ', new_person2);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
